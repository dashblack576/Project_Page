# Local Host Project Page

## How To Use

### Requirements

Streamlit is required and can be installed via `pip install streamlit`
Errors might occur because some pages install other dependencies. If this happens, install the missing packages. These might include: `tensorflow, keras, and keras-nlp`.

### Usage

One all the requirements are installed, download the git repository with `git clone https://github.com/dashblack576/Project_Page.git` move all the files into the directory of your choice. Once the files are collected in one repository, simply run the run.bat file and the landing page should load on a local host. You may experience a problem at first from antivirus software, but streamlit is safe and this should pass. If the run file doesn't work, navigate to the given directory where the Project Page files are stored and run the command `streamlit run landing_page.py`. 

## Support Projects

As for right now, only summarization is supported. I'm working on implementing my other projects soon, though.
