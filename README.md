# Local Host Project Page

## How To Use

### Requirements

Streamlit is required and can be installed via `pip install streamlit`
Errors might occur because some pages install other dependencies. If this happens, install the missing packages. These might include: `tensorflow, keras, and keras-nlp`.

## Usage

One all the requirements are installed, download the git repository with `git clone https://github.com/dashblack576/Project_Page.git` move all the files into the directory of your choice. Once the files are collected in one repository, simply run the run.bat file and the landing page should load on a local host. If the run file doesn't work, navigate to the given directory where the Project Page files are stored and run the command `streamlit run landing_page.py`.
